# Trundle: game plan

Updated September 24, 2026. This is the source of truth for product direction. It
replaces the September 21 plan, which is archived at
[docs/archive/GAME_PLAN_2026-09-21.md](docs/archive/GAME_PLAN_2026-09-21.md). The
reasoning behind it is in [docs/IDEA_SCORECARD.md](docs/IDEA_SCORECARD.md),
[docs/VALIDATION_RESEARCH.md](docs/VALIDATION_RESEARCH.md) and
[docs/DESIRE_VALIDATION.md](docs/DESIRE_VALIDATION.md) (what makes people want it).

## The product in one line

**Your apps go to sleep at bedtime and don't wake up until you get out of bed.**

Trundle is a paid iOS app for people who scroll in bed at both ends of the night.
At bedtime it blocks the apps the user chose. In the morning they stay blocked
until the user walks 200 steps. A sassy, tired raccoon voice runs the whole thing.
He's strict about the situation and never shames the user.

## Why this, and why now

- **The problem is big.** Pew (Sept 2026): 62% of 18–29s say their phone hurts
  their sleep, and only 25% of people who tried to cut back say it went extremely or very well.
- **The bedtime lock is table stakes.** Opal advertises it ("Sleep Time 10PM–8AM
  Block All"). **The morning is the wedge.** Opal's morning ends at a clock time,
  even if you're still in bed. Trundle's ends when you get up. Morning-task apps
  are a proven market: Alarmy has 82M downloads, and Early went from launch to
  about $50K a month in four months.
- **Other indies are circling.** Groggy (Sept 16, 2026) and BedLock (April 2026)
  have the same idea and 0 ratings. Speed, distribution, voice and reliability
  decide the winner.
- **It fits the founder.** Short-form video is how this category grows, and a hard
  paywall makes paid creators profitable.

**What we compete on:** the morning hook, the voice, and never failing silently.
**Not:** blocking features, stats, or sleep tracking.

## Core loop

1. During onboarding the user picks the apps that sleep at night, a bedtime and a
   morning start time. **Tonight's lock is scheduled before onboarding ends.**
2. At bedtime, Trundle falls asleep and the selected apps are blocked.
3. At the morning start time the step count begins. The apps stay blocked.
4. The user walks 200 steps and the apps wake up until the next bedtime.
5. An always-blocked list stays blocked in every state. If an app is on both
   lists, the always-blocked rule wins.

Rules carried over from the previous plan:
- Steps count from the morning start time, including steps taken before the app
  is opened. Opening the app doesn't start the count.
- The count resets each morning. Reopening the app never resets progress.
- Bedtime takes precedence: walking at night never unlocks apps.
- 200 is a default to test, not a validated number. The target is adjustable.
- The user controls the schedule and both app lists at all times.

## Humane exits (required for v1)

- **Passes:** a few scarce passes a month for sick days, travel or a baby asleep
  in the room, written in his voice. Using one unlocks the morning without
  walking. Exact count and duration are to be tuned.
- **Emergency unlock:** always available, deliberate, and never clears the
  always-blocked list silently.
- **Accessible alternative:** a non-walking way to wake him (to be designed), for
  users who can't walk 200 steps.
- No money stakes, penalties, streak shaming or "neglect" states.

## Reliability is a feature

- Build the steps on CoreMotion (`CMPedometer`), counted live in the app while he
  narrates. **Don't use HealthKit** for the gate: it lags and can't be read while
  the phone is locked. Add light anti-shake checks.
- The dependable unlock is a tap on the shield or opening the app to check steps.
  **Don't promise an automatic unlock** until it has been shown to work on a
  device.
- Chain DeviceActivity schedules in short intervals (under about 45 minutes)
  rather than one long schedule. Run a nightly self-check that shields applied.
- Detect when Screen Time access has been revoked or protection is off, and say so
  plainly. Never imply protection is active when it isn't.

## Look and voice

How to keep the brand from reading as generated:
[docs/BRAND_PRINCIPLES.md](docs/BRAND_PRINCIPLES.md).

- **Visual direction: "Nocturne"** ([docs/COLOR_RESEARCH.md](docs/COLOR_RESEARCH.md),
  section 5).
  - A monochrome interface with white pill buttons and frosted chips.
  - A heavy italic serif for his lines. No brand accent color.
  - Color comes from imagery. The references are the user's three screenshots
    (the art-events app, the travel app, Opal).
- **The voice is the mascot.** v1 has no illustrated art: his lines, set big, carry
  the personality. Later options, none needed for launch: photographing a
  customized plush raccoon, or commissioned art. Don't ship raw AI-generated
  mascot art.
- **Where he shows up:** the block screen (a small icon plus his line as the
  title; iOS doesn't allow full-screen art there), the morning walk, the home
  state, notifications, and the morning share card.
- **Never glow** (CLAUDE.md). Never troll-like, and never icy blue (see the LoL
  Trundle conflict).
- **Name: Trundle** (decided September 24, 2026; Bandit dropped). Still run a
  USPTO class 9 check and a social handle check before launch
  ([docs/IDEA_SCORECARD.md](docs/IDEA_SCORECARD.md)).
- **Voice rules and line bank:** [docs/VOICE.md](docs/VOICE.md).

## Money

- **Hard paywall at the end of onboarding:** three plans on one page (changed
  2026-09-25 from the user's references): Lifetime $99.99 once, **Annual $39.99 with
  a 7-day free trial, selected by default** and shown with its per-month price
  ($3.33/month), and Monthly $9.99 (no trial). Plain renewal terms (App Store
  guideline 3.1.2): the billed amount is the biggest price on each card. No fake
  countdowns, struck-through prices or hidden prices.
- Keep a freemium fallback ready if word of mouth is weak (Opal's revenue grew after
  it went freemium).
- **Onboarding shape:** about 25 screens (details in
  [docs/ONBOARDING_CONVERSION.md](docs/ONBOARDING_CONVERSION.md)):
  1. A 7-question quiz.
  2. The "hours a week on your phone in bed" number.
  3. Set up apps and times ("tonight's lock is ready").
  4. A two-page paywall with a 7-day trial on the annual plan.
  5. The lock **arms only after purchase**. Nothing ever blocks the phone of
     someone who hasn't paid.

## Build order

**Step 0: now**
- Finish Apple Developer Program enrollment. The team ID error is still open.
- Register the App ID, the three extension IDs and the App Group, then request
  Family Controls (Distribution) for each. Follow
  [docs/ENTITLEMENT_SETUP.md](docs/ENTITLEMENT_SETUP.md).
- Set `ios.bundleIdentifier` in `app.json`.
- Dev is on Linux with no confirmed Mac, so native extensions are built with EAS
  Build.

**Step 1: device spike (about 2 weeks, before any real UI).** On a real iPhone,
prove:
1. Blocks apply at bedtime and hold for 3+ nights with the app closed.
2. The morning step count unlocks at 200, from the shield tap or the app.
3. Revocation is detected.

If any of these fail, stop and redesign.

**Step 2: v1**
- Onboarding quiz and paywall.
- Night, morning and day home states.
- Morning walk screen with a live count and his lines.
- Custom shield text.
- Always-blocked list.
- Passes, emergency unlock and the accessible alternative.
- Reliability checks and honest status.
- Morning share card ("Bed 11:41. Up 7:02. 213 steps. Still disappointed.").
- Settings.

**Step 3: v1.1, only after real users**
- A real alarm (AlarmKit) to lead with the morning.
- Streak widget and a bedtime Live Activity.
- Buddy/couples mode: a partner gets a message if bedtime breaks; no money moves.
- Naps, both scheduled and "tuck him in now".
- Put him to bed early.
- An opt-in "went to bed earlier" dataset for a published result later.

## Marketing (runs alongside the build, starting now)

- **Before the app exists:** 20–30 concept videos across angles, linking to a
  waitlist.
  - The hook to test first: "I have to walk 200 steps before TikTok works."
  - Signal to look for: "what app is this?" comments and sign-ups.
- **At launch:** daily founder videos across 2–3 accounts, plus paid niche
  creators at $2–3 CPM.
  - Measure payers per 1K views, not views.
  - $10K a month takes roughly 20–25M views a year.

## Gates

A TestFlight group of 100–300 users should show:
- **D30:** at least 20% still have blocking active.
- Fewer than 1 in 50 nights with a missed block.
- Roughly 30% or more of trials turning into paid subscriptions.

Pass, then launch hard. Fail, then fix it or stop, **before** spending the
audience. Expectations: most new apps stay under $1K a month; a strong result is
$10–25K a month by month 12 ([docs/IDEA_SCORECARD.md](docs/IDEA_SCORECARD.md)).

## Ideas to test (not committed yet)

From [docs/DESIRE_VALIDATION.md](docs/DESIRE_VALIDATION.md), September 24, 2026.

- **Lead hook:** test "My phone won't work until I get out of bed" against "I have
  to walk 200 steps before TikTok works."
- **Positioning:** "the one lock you can't beat from bed."
- **Back-to-bed risk:** after unlocking, people may get back into bed and scroll.
  Measure it in the concierge week.
  - Candidate fix, a two-part wake-up: 100 steps, then the last 100 count only
    after about 10 minutes.
- **Viral features:**
  1. His voice as real audio, aiming to become a TikTok sound.
  2. Roasts when the anti-shake check catches cheating.
  3. An "excuse court" for passes, with rulings from the line bank rather than AI.
  4. The morning share card as a receipt, including "time wasted in bed".
  5. A falling-asleep goodnight at bedtime.

## Not part of the plan

- Money stakes or escrow, punishments, guilt mechanics, or a pet that suffers.
- Timed earned unlocks (walk to buy 10–15 minutes of access) or AI/photo
  verification of goals.
- Stats dashboards, sleep scores, soundscapes, or sleep tracking.
- Android, squads or leaderboards, a cosmetic economy, NFC.
- Illustrated mascot art for v1.
- Weekly pricing.
