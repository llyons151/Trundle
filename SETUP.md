# Trundle — setup notes

Product source of truth: [GAME_PLAN.md](GAME_PLAN.md). The app is currently a visual
prototype; native blocking, scheduling, and the morning step gate are not connected.
The technical notes below are earlier implementation leads, not verified SDK 57
guarantees. Check current official documentation before implementing native services.

## How iOS blocking works
Apple's Screen Time API, three frameworks:
- `FamilyControls` — permission prompt and the app picker (`FamilyActivityPicker`).
- `ManagedSettings` — puts the block screens ("shields") on the chosen apps.
- `DeviceActivity` — schedules and background monitoring, runs in an app extension.

Limits to design around:
- The shield screen allows only a title, subtitle, icon and two buttons. No custom UI,
  and it can't deep-link straight into our app.
- The apps the user picks come back as opaque tokens — our code can't see which apps
  they are.
- The APIs don't really work in the simulator. A real iPhone is required.

## Accounts and approvals
- Apple Developer Program: $99/yr.
- Family Controls entitlement: the development version works immediately. The
  distribution version needs a request form to Apple for the app's bundle ID and each
  extension's bundle ID. Approval can take days to weeks — apply on day one.

## Build route
Development machine is Linux; Xcode only runs on macOS.

An Expo (React Native, TypeScript) project has been scaffolded in this folder, so the
working route is:

- **Expo + `react-native-device-activity` + EAS Build.** EAS compiles on cloud Macs, so
  it works from Linux. Needs a custom dev client (Expo Go can't load the Screen Time
  native code). Extension problems have to be debugged without Xcode. Library's current
  state not yet checked.

Fallback if that gets painful: a used Mac mini (~$300–500) and native Swift/SwiftUI for
the extensions.

## Gotchas
- After installing any package, stop the dev server and restart it with
  `npx expo start -c`. A server that was already running keeps compiling with its old
  setup and caches the bad output. Symptom seen on the phone: "runtime not ready …
  cannot read property 'code' of undefined" (the animation library compiled without
  its plugin).
- Don't open `localhost` links on the phone — scan the QR code from `npx expo start`.

## Native work for the current plan

- Keep scheduled and always-blocked app selections distinct. Waking Trundle must
  only release scheduled restrictions.
- Persist the bedtime/morning schedule and wake state; native enforcement cannot
  depend on the dashboard remaining open.
- Evaluate native step-count access for the 200-step morning ritual, including
  historical steps since the morning start, permissions, device support, and
  background execution. Do not assume a foreground live counter handles this.
- Verify how reaching the step target can update shields when the app is closed.
  If opening Trundle is necessary, document that limitation in the experience.
- Test on a real iPhone across restarts, midnight, schedule edits, time-zone changes,
  permission changes, and overlapping restrictions.
- Resolve manual sleep, bypass, and accessibility flows from the game plan before
  implementing their enforcement rules.
